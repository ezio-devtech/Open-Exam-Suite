# Open-Exam-Suite

I've finally gotten tired of the tyranny of Avanset and how they have made it next to impossible to make use of VCE files because of their prohibitive subscription prices. This project seeks to create an open Exam designer and simulator that will create a file based on XML. It would be the open source solace for those wanting to take IT related â€¦


It'll need help with the conversion of the exissting vce exams to this new platform.
