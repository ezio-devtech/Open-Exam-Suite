# Open-Exam-Suite

I've finally gotten tired of the tyranny of Avanset and how they have made it next to impossible to make use of VCE files because of their prohibitive subscription prices. This project seeks to create an open Exam designer and simulator that will create a file based on XML. It would be the open source solace for those wanting to take computer based simulated examination.

The *.oef format that Open Exam Suite understands is just basically a zip file with an XML file containing the exam text and all the pictures associated with questions 

I made some radical changes to the code and  felt that it would be appropriate to create a new respository at https://github.com/bolorundurowb/Open-Exam-Suite-2.0 but with follwing that this has, I will try and merge the changes I made in that version into this version and also include features I have been working on for an enterprise version of this exam suite.


I'll need community help with the conversion of the existing vce exams to this new format. 

V1.0 features
1.) Multiple options per question
2.) Supports sectioning of exams
3.) Supports exam properties such as time limits etc...

v2.0 proposed features
1.) Support for answers while creating the exam
2.) New Creator UI
3.) More stable and intuitive UI
